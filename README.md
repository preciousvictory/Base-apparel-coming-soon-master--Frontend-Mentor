## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Js

### What I learned

- I learnt how to space the letters not just the default spacing using letter-spacing.
```css
.col-1 h1{
    font-size: 60px;
    font-weight: 600;
    letter-spacing: 18px;
}
```
- I also learnt how to stack/ overlap two elements together using the position property.
I gave the parent element `position: relative` then I gave the child element `position: absolute`, Then specifying the exact position using the values (left, right, top, bottom).
```css
.col-1 form{
    position: relative;
    width: 80%;
}

.col-1 .child{
    position: absolute;
}

.col-1 .email{
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
    ...
}
```

-   I also learnt how to use gradient. 
```css
.col-1 .button{
    background-image: linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(0, 80%, 86%), hsl(0, 74%, 74%));
    ...
}
```

- I also learnt how to make images reponsive in css using backgroung-image property.
```css
.col-2{
    background-image: url(../images/hero-desktop.jpg);
    background-position: center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
}

@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
   .col-2{
        background-image: url(../images/hero-mobile.jpg);
    }
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
### Continued development

- CSS Grid
- JS form validation

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient) - This helped me for learn how to use linear gradients. 
- [Example resource 2](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-stack-elements-in-css/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to stack more than more elements on each other. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
